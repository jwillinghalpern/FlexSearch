# FlexSearch
FlexSearch Module for Filemaker

Overview

A portable search bar object that performs 2 key functions, 1) a regular quickfind on the designated quickfind fields, and 2) a "FlexSearch" which is like a quickfind but also matches the middles and ends of words, and acts much like a "*" wildcard character.
